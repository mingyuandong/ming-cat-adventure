        The history of cats is hard to be recounted by
        us mere humans.
        Basically, cats started to exist on earth
        around 1000 - 100000000000000 years ago.
        Don't ask me to count the zeros coz I'm lazy.
        Then, humans discovered how cats could
        help them catch mice, so we started to domesticate
        them and invent a bunch of breeds. <br>
