        My beloved soldier, <br>
        You are entering the Dark Forest riding Lilas the Tabby.
        The ground is dusty as the sun begins to set at 4:30.
        You see two paths in front of you.
        Which way do you want to take, my brave soldier? <br>
        <a href="../2Dark-Path/index.html">
            Left: dark path with a shinny pink flowers<a></a><br>
        <a href="../2Bright-Path/index.html">
            Right: bright path with spikes on the ground<a></a>
    </p>
