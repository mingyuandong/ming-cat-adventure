    <p>
        You chose to enter the flowery dark path. <br>
        The flowers smell very good, which makes you confident.
        You kept riding, until you encountered a tunnel and a lake in the front.
        The tunnel seems like a bottomless hole. You are not sure where it will lead you.
        The river seems narrow, but the water runs in the velocity of 100 miles per second.
        You choose to:<br>
        <a href="../3Cave/index.html">
            Enter the cave <a></a><br>
        <a href="../3River/index.html">
            Swim across the river <a></a><br>
