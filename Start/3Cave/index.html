        You chose to enter the cave with your cute cat.<br>
        You walk forward, and after five feet, bump against some kind of wall.
        It's not a bottomless hole after all. You light up your match to see what's up,
        but boom - the cave explodes. I guess the fire lighted some chemicals and triggered the explosion.
        <h1 class = "death">You died.</h1><br>
