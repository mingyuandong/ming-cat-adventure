    You entered the castle. <br>
    And a glitch -- a giant bear with a sausage head flashes and appears in front of your eyes.
    "I'm the Servant of this castle. What are you doing here, mortal?" Sausage asks.
    "I'm just an adventurer."
    "I'll ask you a question. You have to answer to keep going on your adventure."
    "Sure. I accept this challenge," you say it so confidently.
    "Okay. The question is: What's the name of that creature?" Sausage points at your cat.
    You answer: <br>
    <a href="../5Lilas/index.html">
        "That's Lilas the Tabby Cat." <a></a><br>
    <a href="../5Senna/index.html">
        "That's Senna the Seal Cat." <a></a><br>
