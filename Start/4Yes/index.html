    You entered the castle. <br>
    And a glitch -- a giant sausage bear flashes and appears in front of your eyes. <br>
<img src = "image/4Survival.png" alt="4Survival" width = 400px> <br>
    "I'm Sausage, the Servant of this castle. What are you doing here, mortal?" Sausage asks.
    "I'm just an adventurer."
    "I'll ask you a question. You have to answer to keep going on your adventure."
    "Sure. I accept this challenge," you say it so confidently.
    "Okay. The question is: What's the name of that creature?" Sausage points at your cat.
    You answer: <br>
    <a href="../5Lilas/index.html">
        "That's Lilas the Tabby Cat." <a></a><br>
    <a href="../5Senna/index.html">
        "That's Senna the Seal Cat." <a></a><br>
