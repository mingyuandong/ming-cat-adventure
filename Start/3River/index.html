        You chose to jump into the 100mi/s water. <br>
        The second you jump in, a fish with the velocity of 1000mi/s appears to the surface.
        He asks: "Sup?"
        With the velocity of light, you say: "Please carry me ASAP, or I think I'll be drowned in the next second."
        The friendly fish immediately gets under you and your beloved cat, and holds you guys up onto his head.
        He carries you to the other side of the river.
        You thank the fish, and continue your brave adventure.<br>
